now that we have the brief discussion on limits out of the way we can proceed into taking derivatives of functions of more than one variable before we actually start taking the rivers of functions of more than one variable let's recall an important interpretation of derivatives of functions of one variable recall that given a function of one variable f of x the derivative F Prime of X represents the rate of change of the function as X changes this is an important interpretation the problem with functions are more than one variable is that there are more than one variable in other words what do we do if we only want one of the variables to change or if we want more than one of them to change in fact if we're going to allow for more than one of the variables to change there are then going to be an infinite amount of ways from the change for instance one variable could be changing classes in the other variable in the function notice as well that it will be completely possible for the function to be changing differently change
