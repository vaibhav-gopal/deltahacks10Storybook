Question: What is an important interpretation of derivatives of functions of one variable?
Answer: The derivative of a function of one variable represents the rate of change of the function as one variable changes.

Question: What is an issue with interpreting derivatives of functions of more than one variable in the same way?
Answer: There are multiple variables, so there are many ways the variables could change that would affect the rate of change of the function as a whole. 

Question: What may happen if we want only one of the variables to change while taking the derivative of a function of more than one variable? 
Answer: There will be an infinite amount of ways for this to happen. 

Question: Why is it important to consider how the function changes differently when allowing more than one variable to change in the process of taking the derivative of a function of more than one variable? 
Answer: We want to consider how the function changes differently to understand the rate of change of the function as a whole, as this will provide us with the derivative.
