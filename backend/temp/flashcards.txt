Here is a set of flashcards to help you remember the key points about electromagnetism and the gas law: 

1. Question: What is electromagnetism?
Answer: The study of electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles.

2. Question: What are the key concepts of electromagnetism?
Answer: Electric fields, magnetic fields, and electric charges.

3. Question: What is the gas law?
Answer: The gas law, also known as the gas theorem or Galaxy theorem, is one of Maxwell's equations, which relates to the distribution of electric charge and the resulting electric field.

4. Question: What is the equation for the gas law?
Answer: Maxwells equation.

5. Question: What do electric fields do?
Answer: Electric fields are vectors that represent the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a small positive test charge in the presence of the field. 

6. Question: What is the relationship between electromagnetism and gas law? 
Answer: Electromagnetism is not related to the gas law. The gas law specifically relates to the behavior of gases under various conditions.
